# All of Ori-rinth
I made a pack called [All of Origins](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-the-origins) quite a bit back. It did well, but personal life and that crappy Curseforge API update got in the way, so it got abandoned.

For this pack, I'll include origins from Modrinth ONLY. I'd honestly only use mods from modrinth if it was possible, but it's not in the cards quite yet.

## Features
This is not exhaustive. For something more exhaustive, check out the github.
### QOL
There's all the QOL mods on would expect, such as:
* EMI with all of its addons
* [Controlling](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/controlling), to make setting up keybinds easier
* Essential Commands, allowing for you to have a home via /home
* Appleskin
* A whole bunch to mimic optifine's features

    * Currently, shaders aren't included. Iris' most recent version (as of writing this) doesn't work with the most recent version of Sodium. I'd either have to do this or use out-of-date versions of everything.

* Xaero's Minimap & Worldmap
* Waystones
* Gravestones
* Tom's Simple Storage Mod
* Diggus Maximus

### Multiplayer
Of course, I'm focusing on multiplayer with this. Some of these mods include:
* Simple Voice Chat
* Sound Physics Remastered
* Open Parties & Claims

### World Gen
Though this is quite the divergence from the Vanilla Plus Ideals of the original pack, world gen is cool and is real nice with flying origins. Some of my picks include:
* Promenade
* Cinderscapes
* All of YUNG's things
* And more!

### And of course, Origins
Ah, the staple of this pack. Because of the sheer number of origins, I'll need to hold off on this for now. Don't worry, the origin list will be extant shortly.
